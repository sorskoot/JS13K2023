# Development Plan

Must have:
    ✔ Some basic level design @done(23-09-02 21:38)
        ~ standing on the castle wall
    ✔ Indication that you hit an enemy @done(23-09-02 21:46)
        ~ Stop moving and become red for a second and then they disappear
    ✔ Keep track of score @done(23-09-02 22:27)
    ✔ Game over when knights reach the castle @done(23-09-03 21:48)
    ✔ Next level when all knights are killed. @done(23-09-04 22:04)
    ✔ Show score when game over @done(23-09-03 22:56)
    ✔ Play again when game over @done(23-09-04 22:04)
        ~ when they do you'll be kicked out of VR and see the score
    General improvements:
        ✔ Remove Arrow when below the ground @done(23-09-03 12:48)
        ✘ Remove Arrow after X seconds @cancelled(23-09-03 12:48)

    Title screen in HTML:
        ✔ Very basic HTML page with some CSS styling @done(23-09-03 00:18)
        ✔ VR/Start Button @done(23-09-03 00:18)
        ✔ Name of the game @done(23-09-03 00:18)
    Bugs: @critical 
        ✔ Knights are disappearing when another near by is hit. @done(23-09-04 19:31)
    Other enemies:
        ☐ Knights with shields that need to be hit twice
        ☐ Red knights that are faster but spawn a little later
    ☐ More interesting waves of knights
        ☐ Redesign of wave system
Should have:
    ✔ nice level design @done(23-09-10 21:12)
        ✔ Nicer Castle @done(23-09-05 20:59)
        ✔ Add trees @done(23-09-05 21:58)
        ✔ Add shrubberies @done(23-09-05 23:13)
        
    
    ☐ Better enemy animation
    ✔ Better enemy design @done(23-09-10 21:12)
  
    ☐ Error handling / disable VR button on desktop
  
    Architecture:
        ☐ Split Game class into multiple
            XR part should be separated from game logic
    Arrow improvements:        
        ✔ Arrows flying with an arc @done(23-09-03 12:29)
        ☐ Arrow trail
    Title screen in HTML:
        ☐ Show a canvas with the game design as a background
    Sound effects:
        ☐ Hit sound
        ☐ Miss sound
    Title screen in VR:
            We could use a similar approach as with the `Back to Space` game
            with generated textures containing a text. The difficulty is that
            we need create a different shader to render textures. Easiest would
            probably be to create a complete separate pass for text.
        ☐ Name of the game
        ☐ Start button
        ☐ Exit button
Could have:
    ☐ Better collision algoritm (aabb)
    Other enemies:
        ☐ Archers that shoot back so you'll have to duck

    ☐ Desktop support
        ☐ Resize must work then as well.
    ☐ Particle effects
    ☐ great level Design
        ~ more details om towers, etc.
    ☐ Music
    ☐ power ups like flame bows
    ☐ Fights at night with fire effects
    ☐ Enable ESLint again
    ☐ Nicer Towers

Would like:
    ☐ Texture mapping
    ☐ Different scenes
    ☐ Horses with bowmen on them

✔ Setting up the development environment
Creating a WebXR engine:
    Node:
        ✔ basic implementation @done(23-08-19 00:15)
        ✔ translation @done(23-08-19 00:15)
        ✔ rotation @done(23-08-19 00:15)
        ✔ scale @done(23-08-19 00:15)

    ✔ Geometry Node @done(23-08-18 18:06)
    ✔ Scene @done(23-08-18 18:06)
    ✔ Camera @done(23-08-18 18:06)

        ~ similar to Back to Space
    Some design:
        ☐ simple towers and walls

Overall:
    ☐ Finalizing game design details
    ☐ Developing core mechanic - Bow shooting
    ☐ Block out platform (Castle) and enemies
    ☐ Integrating visual assets; Implementing audio features
    ☐ Implementing scoring system
    ☐ Testing, bug fixes, optimizations
    ☐ Final testing before submission
