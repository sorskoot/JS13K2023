## Platform & Tools

Quest 2 with WebXR in TypeScript.

## Purpose of the Game

The game's purpose is to offer players an engaging and immersive experience of being an archer in the 13th century.

## Backstory

In the midst of the 13th century, you find yourself in the role of a steadfast archer named 'Robin' who is tasked with defending the majestic stone fortress of Castle Ravenshaw. This castle, perched on a hill, overlooks vast fields and is the last bastion standing against an oncoming horde. The kingdom has been under relentless attack from a power-hungry warlord seeking to seize all territories within his grasp. His army - an intimidating multitude of footmen and cavalry - steadily advances over the open fields below towards Castle Ravenshaw.

Just when it seemed all hope was lost, Robin takes up arms. Known throughout the kingdom for his exceptional skills as an archer, he had been serving as a simple guard at Castle Ravenshaw but now rises to be its last line of defense. With firm hands and sharp eyes, Robin must utilize his unparalleled precision in archery to stop this invading force from breaching their castle walls.

The future of Castle Ravenshaw and its people hinges upon Robin's bowstring in these desperate times. Will you step into his boots and draw back that arrow? Remember - they're counting on you.

## Target Audience

This game will appeal to virtual reality enthusiasts who enjoy simple yet compelling games in historical settings.

## Gameplay Mechanics

The main mechanic of the game involves shooting arrows from a stationary position on a castle to defend it from invaders approaching from below.

### Shooting Arrows Mechanic

The player uses controls inspired by real-life archery: Pulling back on a virtual bowstring, aiming and releasing to fire an arrow.

### Defending Castle Mechanic

Enemies approach over a field below, coming closer over time. If they reach the castle, it's game over. Players must take them out before they get too close.

## Enemies

Emerging from the dense forest beyond the open fields below, ominous silhouettes of enemy troops can be seen, forming a stark contrast against the eerie twilight. The enemies are a relentless force - an unholy alliance of footmen, horsemen, and siege weapons led by the ruthless warlord. Like drops in an ever-advancing storm, they inch closer with each passing minute towards Castle Windermere.

The footmen form the first wave of attack - grizzled soldiers clad in weathered armor, holding firm to their worn shields and rusting swords. They advance in strategic formations akin to Chess pieces marching upon their board; some swifter but less robust, others slower yet stalwart.

Closely following them are the war-hardened horsemen – agile and threatening due to their speed and the greater damage they can deal if allowed to get too close. Finally, at a painstakingly slow pace roll forward the menacing wooden behemoths — siege towers aiming to crumble Windermere's defenses.

### Improvement for varied gameplay

If time allows you could consider introducing varied enemies with different tactics and speeds to increase difficulty levels or offer gameplay variety. For instance:

-   **Shield-Bearer**: These enemies hold up large shields that require more precise hits (e.g., hitting their legs or shooting when they lower their shield).

-   **Dual-Sword Fighter**: Faster foot soldiers who zigzag on approach making them harder targets.

-   **Heavy Knight**: Slow-moving armored units requiring multiple arrows to take down.

-   **Siege Towers**: Slow-moving structures carrying troops that if not destroyed in time drop hordes of soldiers closer to your castle walls.

These different enemy types would add depth and complexity providing even more challenge and strategic thinking for players.

## Score Mechanic

Each successful hit earns points which accumulate for final score comparison after each round.

## Visual Design

Low-poly and simplistic design due to size restrictions and development time frame. A picturesque 13th-century castle set against beautiful countryside scenery as background, but small and generated as hack.

## Control Scheme

Players will use their VR headset's touch controllers as their virtual bow and arrow.

-   **Draw**: Hold trigger button down, pull back controller
-   **Aim**: Move controller while holding trigger
-   **Shoot**: Release trigger button

### Optional Desktop Control Scheme

-   **Draw**: Holding down the 'Space' key simulates drawing back the bowstring, readying an arrow for firing. A drawn arrow could be represented by a slight zoom effect or a change in cursor design indicating an arrow is ready.
-   **Aim**: Players will use their mouse to look around the environment and aim their shots. The mouse cursor acts as the reticle for aiming.
-   **Shoot**: Releasing the 'Space' key would simulate releasing the bowstring, firing the arrow where the player is aiming with their mouse.

## Audio Design

An immersive soundtrack evoking the 13th century feel and sound effects such as release and hit of arrows, cries or grunts of enemies being hit, alarm bells if enemy is too close to the castle.
